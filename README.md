Fine tuning GPT2 model, so that it can predict Maths riddle. In this i have used Lora PEFT, so that it can be done easily on my poor Laptop too. Also I have made a streamlit app for it so that any one can test it.
Although this assignment was only for learning purposes so the results are not that great, as we have only fine tune it on 25 samples and also to use a gpt2 model, which is very basic adn not good in generation.
